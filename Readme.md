The purpose of this VBA script is to analyze a set of generated stock market data.

The script will loop through all the stocks for each quarter and will output the following:


1)Aggregate data for each ticker symbol within each quarter which would include quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
2)The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

3)The total stock volume of the stock. 

4)The solution also includes the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"

This is my own code and did not receive assistance from anyone.
